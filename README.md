# Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer's Secret Weapon, 6th Edition

This repo is for the 6th edition of my book that was released May 30, 2020

Open source examples for my book "Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer's Secret Weapon" that is available at https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp My book is available to read free online and the PDF for the book is licensed with Creative Common share with no modifications or commercial reuse: this means that you are encouraged to share copies (up to date copies only, please) of the PDF with friends and co-workers. New editions of the book are free if you have purchased the book before. Many thanks to the people who support my writing by purchasing the book!

The source code in this repository may be used either under the Apache 2 or the LGPL version 3 licenses. Use whichever license that works best for you.

Starting December 5, 2020 I have moved most of my personal (non-work related) Common Lisp projects to this repo for my book examples. You may notice subdirectories in **src** that contain code that is not yet (or may never be) in my book. These directories contain the file **NOT_YET_IN_BOOK.md**.

If you notice any errors or have suggestions for improvement, then git pull requests will be appreciated!
